# Fractional-Knapsack
A complete c++ code for fractional knapsack problem
The basic idea of the greedy approach is to calculate the ratio value/weight for each item and sort the item on basis of this ratio. 
Then take the item with the highest ratio and add them and at the end add the next item as much as we can. 
Which will always be the optimal solution to this problem.
